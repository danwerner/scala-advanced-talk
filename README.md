Scala Advanced Features Talk
============================

Interactive presentation explaining and showcasing the more advanced Scala features,
like implicit parameters, implicit conversions, implicit classes, Manifests/TypeTag,
and also [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) features like Monoid syntax
(with `|+|`) and Tagged Types (with `@@`).

This talk was presented by Daniel Werner at SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung in January 2018.

## How to use

Any way you want. My suggestion:

1. Open the project in your IDE, e.g. IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Use `app/Solutions.scala` to showcase features.
3. Open `worksheet.sc` and copy/paste code to execute whenever it seems desirable.
